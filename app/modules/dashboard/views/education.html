                                  <h4>In the initial weeks to get hands on experience on SageMath Development, I started working on the following tickets as described below.</h4>
                                  <p class="text-bold">

                                    In<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24101"> #24101</a> I helped in implementing the Katz Centrality and Katz Matrix methods in the graph module to measure relative influence of a node in a graph network.

                                    In #24094 I helped in implementing the methods such as Effective Resistance, Resistance Matrix and Least Resistance Pairs. These methods help to find the effective resistance between a pair of nodes in a graph network by treating all edges as resistance of 1 ohm.

                                    In #9707 I added a signless option to Laplacian Matrix which is popular now a days to measure signless laplacian.

                                    In #27464 I created this ticket to fix a bug and also use the cython priority_queue instead of python heap to make bidirectional_dijkstra method faster and bug free.

                                    In #27491 I created this ticket to deprecate the parameter copy in networkx_graph method and also to remove some deprecated pieces of code.

                                    In # 27507 I created this ticket to fix some documentation errors in generic_graph.py module.

                                    In #24089 I helped in implementing the methods such as max_common_neighbors and common_neighbors_matrix to find the number of common neighbors between 2 given nodes and find which nodes have the most common neighbors.

                                    In #27496 I proposed and implemented the addition of parameter weight_function for constructing networkx graphs from sage graphs.

                                    In #27501 I created this ticket to add parameters in all_paths method to make use of the multiedges present and return edges with or without labels. Parameters added were

                                    • use_multiedges – to take multiedges into account for enumerating the paths between source and the destination vertices.

                                    • report_edges – to use edges for enumerating the paths instead of vertices as used before.

                                    • label – to use labels while reporting the edges.

                                    In # 27504 Similar to #27501 I added the option to make use of multiedges and report edges instead of vertices for paths in all_simple_paths method of digraph module.

                                    In #27557 I created this ticket to add labels option to the spanning_trees method to include labels while reporting edges in the corresponding spanning trees.

                                    In #27502 I created this ticket to report errors while using pagerank algorithm of Igraph package.

                                    In #27480 I created this ticket to implement the pagerank function for the sage module and make use of underlying networkx, numpy and scipy and igraph pagerank functionality.

                                    In #27538  I created this ticket to report the defect in cycle_basis method which gives wrong results in case of multiedges.

                                    In #27570 I created this ticket to implement a method for finding a minimal weight cycle basis in an undirected weighted graph which has applications in signals and circuit theory.

                                    In #27600 I created this ticket to add parameters by_weight in min_spanning_tree method and fix some errors in the method which was present.
